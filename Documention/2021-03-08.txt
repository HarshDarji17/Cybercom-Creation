* How to Create PWA  in Angular?

 1> Create an Angular application:


      ng new angular-pwa

2>Add @angular/pwa package:

     

      ng add @angular/pwa

3>Understand the files added/modified by @angular/pwa package:

   Added Files :   -> ngsw-config.json and manifest.webmanifest for configuration purposes.
 
                   -> different png files for different splash images for various resolutions icon-128x128.png, icon-144x144.png,
                   icon-152x152.png,  icon-192x192.png, icon-384x384.png, icon-512x512.png.

   Modified Files: ->   angular.json, package.json, index.html and app.module.ts 



   *  ngsw-config.json :

      -> It’s a configuration file in JSON format.

      -> Mainly this file is responsible for the generation of ngsw-worker.js (serviceworker.js).       

  *  manifest.webmanifest :   

      -> it consists of how the PWA application will look when it opens up. 
        
      -> Here you can set options like splash screen icon, background color, display, etc.

  * angular.json :

      -> Added src/manifest.webmanifest file under assets, so that it will be served with the site.
         That links ngswConfigPath and serviceWorker enabling the production configuration in build schematics.

  * app.module.ts :

     -> app.module.ts is used to import theServiceWorkerModule for registering ngsw-config.js (only for production mode).

  4> Run the application locally :

       ->The Angular CLI is limited because the service worker doesn’t work with the ng serve command.
         You have to create a build and host it separately, perhaps using http-server.

         *follow the below steps*

         1> ng build --prod

         2> dist/angular-pwa 
         
         3> cd dist/angular-pwa

         4> npm i -g http-server

         5> http-server

         


* What is NGRX?

       RXJS + REDUX = NGRX

       RXJS -> Observables

      REDUX -> Redux is basically a global state management library taken from react.

* Example:

  videos      food                            welcome {Name}


          Username  ABC

              update

  -> All videos and food loaded using API . User can click again n again food and videos then again n again 
    call the API. There for  you can ngrx and pull down request concept. Same as Username Example.
