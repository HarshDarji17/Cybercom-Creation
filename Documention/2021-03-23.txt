***What is Garbage Collection?
  
--->When program ends the data inside location is garbage which needs to be cleared.
--->In short clear these free locations is the process of collecting the garbage or Garbage Collection or GC.
--->The garbage collection considers references& it tries to release the memory if a location is not "reachable".
--->Memory Allocation is done automatically.



***What is Memory Leakage?

---> A memory leak is one of the worst types of issues you can have . Itâ€™s hard to find,
     hard to debug, and often hard to solve.
---> A Memory Leakage occurs when an application fails to get rid of unused resources.
---> A program to release discaeded memory, causing impaired perfomance or failure.
---> It occours when the memory program does not return or release allocated memory space,
     even after execution,resulting in slower or unresponsive system behavior.
---> A Memory Leak is considerd a failure or bug within the program that holds it.

  * Memory Management:::

       1> Allocate the needed memory
       2> Read and write allocated memory
       3> Release the memory it's not needed to used.

  * Example:

     ---> Assume that we have use two routes in our site 
                      profile and product
  
    ---> In short both data fetching data to api and server then use the
          subscribe to some Observable. When User navigate to the profile to product page
          then destroy the memory of profile component and initilize a product component.
            
    ---> The profile component has subscribed to the some observable . we can  
          navigate the another component and  destroying the profilecomponent.

    ---> Memory leak issue Overcome with the takeUntil + ngOnDestroy pattern.

***3. What is Server Side Rendering?

---> Angular application executes in the browser and rendering pages in the DOM by user actions.

---> Angular application you can run on the server using add Angular Universal and make Angular application SEO friendly.

**Why use Server Side Rendering (SSR)?

---> There are 3 reasons for create angular application with server side rendering.

                1>SEO friendly
                2>Improve performance on mobile
                3>Show the first page quickly

---> Step 1: Install the Angular CLI:

             
                   npm install -g @angular/cli


 
    Step 2: Create Application:


                  ng new my-project

    Step 3: Add Angular Universal in Your Application:

 
                  ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject my-project


   ---> We can  Add this package then generate 5 files:


          1> main.server.ts                   : bootstrapper for server application code
          2>app.server.module.ts              : server-side application module
          3>server.ts                         : express web server
          4>tsconfig.server.json              : TypeScript server configuration
          5>webpack.server.config.js          : webpack server configuration

  Step 4: Run This Application:

            
                 npm run build:ssr
                 npm run serve:ssr


  ---> This application working as nodejs project. 
       You can also run this project using following command.

                
                    node dist/server
